# I'm Yury - aka the Software Magician 🧙‍♂️

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I'm a full-stack developer with a knack for backend infrastructure. Think of me as the wizard behind the curtain, making sure everything runs like a well-oiled machine. I'm a big fan of automation, and I'll turn mountains upside down to make my life easier. I love breaking stuff apart, and with time I've got better at putting it back together.

## 💻 Professional Background

Let's be honest, there's no such thing as a full-stack developer. You're either a frontend dev who can work the server, or a backend dev who can solve client problems. I fall into the latter category. Working in startups, I've had to wear many hats, and I've learned to be comfortable with the uncomfortable. I've worked on everything from frontend to backend, from infrastructure to devops, and led features from product to production ✨  

I've learned to be a jack of all trades, and a master of some.

My journey in tech has led me to work extensively with relational and NoSQL databases, dive deep into the world of AWS, and mastering the art of CI/CD pipelines. Docker and Kubernetes are additional tools that I carry on my belt. I can talk shop with most devops guys, and even understand most of their black magic.

My experience has shaped me into a versatile developer, capable of tackling diverse challenges in the ever-evolving landscape of web development.

## 🎮 Hobbies and Interests

When I'm not on the job, you can find me:

- 🕹️ Gaming, nothing like a good match with a couple of friends
- 📚 Reading sci-fi and fantasy novels, with some books on productivity sprinkled in
- 📸 Snapping photos
- 🔧 Tinkering with extensions, tools, plugins
- 🧩 Solving puzzles
- 🛠️ DIYing around the house
- 🏡 Venturing into the realm of home automation

## 📊 Fun Facts

- I'm your go-to guy if you need help reaching the top shelf. #tall-people-problems
- Sushi enthusiast 🍣 - I could probably live off of it!
- As a kid, I had a collection of 50+ paper airplane designs 🛩️
